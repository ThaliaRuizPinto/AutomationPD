First automation projects files
This is my first automation project. It consists of a pyhton code which uses Openpyxl library to manage and execute operations in an excel database. The bank where I work at needs to place a FLAG in some workers using different logics, this process used to be done manually four times a month which usually used to take from 40 to 60 minutes. This automation uses the logics and validates by itself the workers who have the flag. This is the first version, I intend to use multithreading for the next one so the time used running the code will be less.
